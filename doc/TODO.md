# TODO
- Add "son" under salsa, because this is actually a problem at socials too now.
- On some phones, the text doesn't rescale. May have to do with either the absolute pixel threshold used to determine isMobile or else the font it switches to. For the smaller buttons you probably want much smaller font anyway.
- You could technically keep it working even when the phone is locked by tracking when a button was last pressed and then just updating based on that whenever you get the chance.
